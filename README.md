# spaceX_project
In this capstone project, we aim to predict the successful landing of the SpaceX Falcon 9 first stage after rocket launch. Given the significant cost savings associated with reusing the first stage, determining its landing outcome is crucial for estimating the overall launch cost. The project involves the following steps:

Data Collection and Wrangling: We'll gather data using web scraping and RESTful APIs, converting it into a structured format for analysis in a Python Pandas dataframe.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Through scatter plots, bar charts, and SQL queries, we'll explore the dataset, identify patterns, and extract insights to guide further analysis.

Interactive Visual Analytics and Dashboards: Utilizing Plotly Dash and Folium libraries, we'll build interactive dashboards and maps to analyze launch records and visualize the launch site proximity.

Predictive Analysis (Classification): Using machine learning techniques, we'll split the data into training and testing sets, train different classification models (such as SVM, Classification Trees, and Logistic Regression), and perform hyperparameter grid search to optimize model performance. The best-performing model will be determined using the test data.

Overall, this project leverages data science methodologies and machine learning techniques to predict the success of Falcon 9 first stage landings, providing valuable insights for decision-making in the aerospace industry.
